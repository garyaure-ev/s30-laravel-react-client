# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Prepare Environment Variables

Create `.env` file inside the app root folder and add the following line:

`REACT_APP_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:8000/api`

Please make sure the URL matched the backend API path, the above is based on the default `php artisan serve` of Laravel Framework.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

## `npm install`

Make sure to install packages for this React App

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
